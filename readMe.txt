Steps to run code:
Requirments:
google account to use colab

Process:
upload  ipynb file in google colab
Change runtime of colab to gpu
Then start running the code cell by cell
In this process you need to verify your gmail by a code 
Then create a cloud project in your cloud
After download of dataset starts stop downloading after 2 or 3 candidates.(colab gives limited disk space so not possible to run all)
If you want to run more candidates repeat the whole process with 2 new fresh candidates
It will take around 2-3 hours to run code for 3 patients.
